# 🔒 TBX Core Security Policy

## 🛡 Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security issue in TBX Core, **please do not** open a public GitHub issue. Instead, report it privately to maintainers via:

📧 **Email:** security@teachblox.com  
🔐 **PGP Key:** [Link to PGP Key] *(if applicable)*

All security reports will be thoroughly investigated, and we will work with you to resolve any valid issues promptly.

## 🛠 Security Best Practices
To ensure the safety of our users and developers, TBX Core follows industry best practices:

- **Smart Contract Audits:** All major releases undergo independent audits before deployment.
- **Bug Bounty Program:** We encourage ethical hacking and vulnerability disclosure via responsible channels.
- **Encrypted Key Management:** TBX Core does not store private keys; they are encrypted and stored client-side.
- **Minimized Attack Surface:** Only essential data is stored on-chain to prevent unnecessary exposure.

## 📜 External Audits
TBX Core undergoes periodic security audits by third-party firms. Reports will be made publicly available whenever possible.

## ⚠ Responsible Disclosure
If you are reporting a security vulnerability, please:
1. Contact us **privately** before disclosing it publicly.
2. Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce the issue.
3. Allow us reasonable time to investigate and deploy a fix.
4. Refrain from exploiting the vulnerability for personal gain or disruption.
